### 2. Opening Remarks

### 3. Let's Try It!

### 4. Discussion of Teaching Ideas
---

# Opening Remarks

### 1. Teaching code
### 2. Code literacy learning goals
### 3. Python as a first language
### 4. Jupyter Notebooks
### 5. Literate coding

---
# Teaching Code

### 1. Large gap between parts and whole
### 2. Lot's of rote learning needed
### 3. Tension between understanding computation and "doing things with code"
### 4. Easiest methods are clickology and lecture
### 5. Some students need a lot of extra time

---
# Code literacy learning goals

### 1. Break out of memorizing procedures
### 2. Learn syntax, types, and conventions by playing
### 3. Slow down procedure to test undertsanding
### 4. Place emphasis on habits of mind
### 5. Express what's happenening, and why, using natural language

---
# Python as a first language
### 1. Easy syntax
### 2. Huge user community
### 3. Imperative or procedural programming is just fine
### 4. Also supports object-oriented approaches
### 5. Amazing extensions of core functionality with libraries
---
# Jupyter Notebooks
### 1. Approachable graphic user interface
### 2. Easy to write working Python and see the result
### 3. Jupyter "magics" make certain actiosn very easy to do
### 4. Notebooks can be shared via Github
### 5. Notebook server provides a way to collaborate and access high-powered computational resources
### 6. Great for "literate" approaches
---
# Literate coding
### 1. Literate programming is a philosophy of documentation

> > The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. ... He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other.

> --Donald Knuth

### 2. Literate coding or scripting applies the communicative philosophy to snippets and other code
### 3. Emphasize what's happening and how, what the approach is, how it fits into a context.
