## This is a brief list of things to try in Jupyter

#### Notebook Interface

* Insert a Code Cell by locating the "Insert" Menu item and clicking "Insert > Cell above"
* Try changing it to a Markdown Cell. Click on the cell, locate the "Cell" Menu item, and click "Cell > Cell Type > Markdown." Now try entering some Markdown and press <em>play</em>.
* Try the same procedure but choose "Heading cell."

#### Basic Python

Store an integer as a variable with a line of code like
```
myNumber = 5
```
or
```
a = 7
```
then press the icon that looks like a <em>play</em> button or "Cell > Run Cell"

Try doing math on your new integer:
```
a + 22
```
Don't forget to press <em>play</em>!

Try creating a string. This is a common datatype for text.
```
myName = "Matt"
```
Notice the quotation marks. To see why these matter try this code:
```
a = "5"
a*12
```
Did you get an error? That's because a is a string, not an integer!

That's all for now! Next, try the literate coding exercise.
