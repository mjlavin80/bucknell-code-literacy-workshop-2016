# Literate Programming Activity

This folder houses materials on the literate programming activity for the workshop.

## Instructions
#### For this activity, we will break into teams of five or six people. Once gathered at a computer, create a Jupyter Notebook for your team by following these steps:

* Go to [https://notebook.thedatahumanist.website](https://notebook.thedatahumanist.website) and enter the Notebook Server password
* In the upper right hand corner, click "New" and select "Python" at the bottom of the dropdown menu
* A new tab will open. At the very top, next to the word "jupyter," you'll see the word <em>Untitled</em>. Click it.
* Now just type to rename your notebook. Fun team names are encouraged.  

#### Now that you have a notebook, try playing around with Jupyter a little. You might want to start with the guided tour.

* To activate the tour, click "Help > User Interface Tour"

#### Click the link below for some other things to try:

#### Now it's time to Work with the Zotero API!

* Go back to [https://notebook.thedatahumanist.website](https://notebook.thedatahumanist.website) and click on the file named "zotero_snippet.py"
* The script is divided into 17 lines of code. Select the first line, copy it to the clipboard, and go back to the your Notebook. 
* Paste the first line of code into a Notebook code cell and press <em>Play</em>

(Build it so it instructs the group from there)
