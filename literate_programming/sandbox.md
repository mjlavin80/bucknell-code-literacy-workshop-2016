* Store an integer as a variable with a line of code like
```
myNumber = 5
```
or
```
a = 7
```
then press the icon that looks like a <em>play</em> button or "Cell > Run Cell"

* Try doing math on your new integer:
```
a + 22
```
Don't forget to press <em>play</em>!

* Try creating a string. This is a common datatype for text.
```
myName = "Matt"
```
Notice the quotation marks.

* To see why these matter try this code:
```
a = "5"
a*12
```
Did you get an error? That's because a is a string, not an integer!
