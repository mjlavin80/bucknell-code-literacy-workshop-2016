# Pre-workshop Survey

This folder houses materials related to the pre-workshop survey. The [Live Poll] (http://etc.ch/8eiq) is administered via directpoll.com. Instead of offering an entire survey, Direct Poll allows the poll administrator to open up 
one question for replies and then immediately show the results. As a result, the [Live Poll] link will automatically take you to the current question.

The [Live Results] (http://directpoll.com/r?XDbzPBd3ixYqg8WPzpfDnVfjI28jZvhGf0QzP2FvUoa) link will take you to a page where you can browse through all of the questions in the poll and see how our cohort has answered. 

I have created two additional files to archive [the survey](./questions.md) and [participant responses](results.md). The results page is currently empty, as the workshop has not yet taken place. I will update this folder with responses 
on or after October 29, 2016.
