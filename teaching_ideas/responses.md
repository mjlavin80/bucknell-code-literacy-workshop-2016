## What barriers have you encountered when teaching code or highly procedural digital material to students? Or as a student?

(librarian learners) time commitment, lack of relevance to their daily work requirements, applicability to usable solutions (i.e. great, I know how to use BASH but what does it actually do that will be useful to me?), tech issues (pc, installing Cygwin without admin access)

precision, attention span

I am new to this type of material. My biggest barrier is not knowing where to start or what to expect to learn
Teacher - fitting it into the curriculum
Student - time and figuring out what steps I need to take to connect it to my research/get it to do what I want it to do

Balancing teaching how to do something specific vs. teaching deeper understanding of tool/platform

To customize the code for specific purposes is a challenge.

Different levels/pacing (some people done, some people still struggling to find the tutorial). Not seeing the relevance. Transition from being able to follow a tutorial to actually designing code/solving problems.

People don't like to think in terms of concept and logic. Some students want to just try to plug things into code and do stuff. That usually leads to frustration because it doesn't work.

## What strategies have you encounter or employed to avoid clickology or excessively rote teaching? What has worked best? What has not worked well?

Have no ideas (that's why I'm here)

keeping things conversational, making mistakes and fixing them together. Cutting and pasting code doesn't stick.

Purposeful or meaningful learning is important

As a student, I've had to do a Python Codecademy course as hw and discuss it in seminar - very effective.

Finding ways to put the technology away and using pencil/paper, whiteboard, post-its, etc. has almost always been shockingly effective.

I have never taught codes to students.

Interactive activities, role-playing, problem-based teaching. 

Focus on concepts and try to engage in student discussion

## Have you had experience with flipped classroom methods in the context of digital competencies or literacies? If so, how would you rate the success or lack thereof?

no

Not too much experience teaching this material, but I think applied learning is valuable.

I tried, but it didn't work out as well as I had expected. It's much less time consuming for students to gain technical knowledge with hands-on instruction in the classroom than watching videos before class.

Online teaching--success depends a lot on good design and clearly written instructions. Getting students to collaborate and answer each other's questions works great. LMS is a limitation; like the idea of methods that get students out of that, but challenges. Balance between teaching and tech support.

I have heard of them. Personally I don't like the idea so would not do it for my own class.

## What additional ideas do you have to help students acquire code competency and/or code literacy?

Skip over initial understanding, deliver ready made functioning code, THEN piece apart. Serves as a quick hook to get people interested and -- hopefully -- find something applicable to their day to day life

interpretive dance (I'm not kidding)

It's important for students to work with data that is meaningful to their own research and for them to produce something they can use.

Start out with a discussion about how it's relevant to their field/eventual goals. Then discuss coding as a literacy on par w/ reading and writing in the digital age and talk about why it's important across the board. (I teach a mandatory Freshman comp class.)

I've heard of teaching coding separate from a language, K-12 education with a visual interface. Intriguing but not sure about it. 

Have students work on using code to do things that are interesting and useful for them. I learned programming mostly on my own and use it for functional purposes - not just here is the underlying structure of the language and theoretical things. Show how things can have practical applications.

## Do you have feedback on how this workshop has defined key terms? (e.g., digital literacy and competency, literate coding. etc.)

Fine. Everything was clear.

literate coding! Will incorporate this! 

I became familiar with a new digital tool

Good clarification on the difference between coding and programming. Also, helpful explanation of using natural language in accordance with the instruction/discussion of coding languages.

I really love the idea of literate coding and of reading/understanding code rather than immediately jumping in. (But I come from an English lit background, so...)

Nice Workshop!

## General comments on this workshop:

Really like Jupyter, but having learned in a completely different context (i.e. Cygwin and just going to town on Bash and Python), the interface seemed like a bit of a hindrance. Might be useful for completely novice users.

Many thanks

I have a lot of learning to do.

Great! Really liked the structure and the modeling of the usefulness of tech-heavy tools like github and Jupyter. Really liked the "ideas" portion. Directions for group activity could've been a little clearer/explained.
